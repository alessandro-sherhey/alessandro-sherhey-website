            <h1>💻 Behind the Scenes</h1>
            <p>I made this webpage for those who are interested in knowing how this website was made.
                But that's not the only reason for this: i made this website also for those who may want
                to know how to build their own website and deploy it.<br>
                Note: this webpage could have bad content. The structure of the page, the text, or the images
                could be changed at any moment.

            <h2>The most important tools I've used</h2>
            <p>You're probably asking yourself <em>"What did this guy use to make his own website?"</em>. 
            In this section of the website I'll tell you the <strong>most important</strong> tools I've
            used to make all this. With "tools" I mean programs and websites.</p>

                        <p>In my opinion this is one of the best IDEs you can find. There is a reason if many
                            people recommend it. Wanna take a look at the official website?

                        <h3>GitHub</h3>
                        <p>GitHub is an awesome website for developers. I'm currently using it to make this 
                            website <strong>open-source</strong>, and to allow people (and me) to report issues
                            for this website. The most important thing for me is that GitHub has a feature called
                            GitHub Pages, which allows you to deploy your website on their servers <strong>for free.</strong>
                            They'll give you a free link, but if you want you can buy a domain and use it on your
                            website. <a href="https://github.com">Click here</a> to go to the GitHub's website.

                        <p>Live Server is an extension for VS Code. It allows you to create a web server directly on
                            your computer to preview the website you're currently writing. It also has live reload. 
                            That means that to update the website preview you don't need to stop the server and restart
                            it, you can simply save the file you're currently editing. That's a really fast thing to do,
                            just press <strong>Ctrl + S</strong> or <strong>CMD + S</strong>.

                        <p>Codecademy is an awesome platform to learn how to code. Because of it now I'm able to build
                            static websites from scratch. But that's not all. You can learn other languages such as JavaScript,
                            Python, C++ and many more. This is not sponsored, it's just that I love this website and I think
                            other people will find it useful as much as I do. <a href="https://codecademy.com">Click here</a>

        <section id="starting">
            <h2>The starting of the website</h2>
            <p>
            Before starting all the coding stuff I made a <strong>wireframe</strong> of the website. A wireframe is just an
            image representing <strong>only the structure</strong> of the website. For the text I used the classic <em>lorem 
            ipsum</em> text, since this was just for me. To make this wireframe I used <strong>Vectornator</strong>, a vector design
            program for iPhone, iPad and Mac. I used the iPad version to make this wireframe. Here's an image of it. You'll also notice that the design
            is different from the actual website. That's because I had numerous ideas when developing the website, but after
            trying all of them I decided that the actual design was the best one!
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/bts/bts_3_wireframe.png" class="light">
            <img src="/assets/bts/bts_3_wireframe_dark.png" class="dark">
            <p>
                After everything the 1st version of the website was made. But (of course) it wasn't ready yet. There were lots of things missing, the
                most important ones being <strong>dark mode</strong> and <strong>website responsiveness</strong>. But what is website responsiveness?<br> 
                The responsiveness of a website is its ability to resize and change the design for the 
                various screen resolutions available out there. In the PC world it could be easier to make a website responsive, because monitors have
                common resolutions like 1280x720, 1920x1080, 2560x1440 and more. But if we think about mobile devices, do they all have the same screen
                size? No. Some phones are bigger, some are smaller, some have a notch, some have a hole-punch camera, and some are all-screen. We have
                to make our websites easily usable to <strong>everyone</strong>, regardless of them using a smartphone, computer or tablet.<br>
                I wanted to add dark mode too because a lot of people use it, and in my opinion it looks cooler than light mode. You don't want to end 
                like this guy, right?

            <p>While doing all this I tried to give the website a <strong>modern design</strong> by using readable fonts and 
                rounded corners, but I also tried to make website navigation as easy as possible. This is something I personally think all website developers should
                do.</p>

        <section id="colors">
            <h2>What about colors?</h2>
            <p>
                Colors are a <strong>fundamental</strong> part of every website. Without them websites would be plain <strong>boring</strong>.
                Colors can be defined with various types of values,
                but the ones I used were the <strong>hex</strong> ones and the <strong>rgba</strong> ones. There are also other types
                of values such as <strong>hue</strong> and <strong>hsl</strong>. To help myself with all the color codes and with the 
                various shades I used the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">W3 Schools Color Picker</a>.
                Pick a color and you'll see previews of black and white text, both with and without shadows, lighter/darker colors, hue,
                saturation and lightness. And (of course) you'll have the hex, rgb, hue and hsl values. (Not sponsored again, I just like
                the website and I think it'll be useful for other people too).
            </p>
            <img src="/assets/bts/bts_5_colors.png" class="light">
            <img src="/assets/bts/bts_5_colors_dark.png" class="dark">
            <p>
                Developers also use colors to define how important or not is something. For example see how the titles are completely black
                and the paragraphs are dark grey. This is something I did to make the two more distinguishable from each other. And in dark 
                mode you'll see that the titles are white and the paragraphs are light grey. You can also see how the "BETA" text in the navbar
                is inside a red box. That red box draws attention, so everyone will see that this website isn't fully ready yet.

        <section id="remember">
            <h2>How do you remember all the various things in website developing?</h2>
            <p>Most people think that developers are people with superpowers that make them remember every single thing. But that's not
                true. The truth is that <strong>they don't</strong>. Instead we remember what we can, and if we don't remember something,
                we have a problem to solve. That's what programmers do the most: resolve problems. When we have a problem we try to solve
                it with what we remember, but if we don't, Google comes to help us. A quick research can make us remember lots of things.
                And here I'll mention another tool that <strong>a lot</strong> of developers use: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
                MDN Web Docs</a>. These are a <strong>lifesaver</strong> when you don't remember something. <sup>(not sponsored again)</sup>

        <section id="time">
            <h2>How much time do you need to make a website?</h2>
            <p>
                Developing a website can take as little as a few hours, but also as much as a month, or even more. It depends
                entirely on your skills and the complexity of the website you're making. The same is for making new features,
                it can take just a few hours, an entire day or even weeks. To make this webpage it took me around 3/4 hours of
                coding. That's excluding the things I deleted while making the webpage and the time it took to think about what
                to write here and what not.
