            <h2>üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I am Alessandro Sherhey. I'm a 14 year old Italian boy born in Siracusa, Sicily. From when I was a
                kid I had a big passion for coding. Everything started with 
                <a href="https://www.code.org/">code.org</a> 
                when I was in elementary school. Then in middle school I found 
                <a href="https://www.scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a>.
                That was a game changer for me. I even made my first game with it! And now, I'm here, writing
                <strong>real code</strong> for websites. And that's not all. I'm planning to learn 
                <strong>iOS development</strong> after I finish learning how to make websites!

                    <p>
                        I know the HTML programming language pretty well. It's the first programming language I started
                        learning, after block-based programming of course.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I know the Cascading StyleSheet language well too. Not as much as HTML, but I know how to use
                        more advanced things like Flexbox, which will be <strong>vastly</strong> used in this website.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now I'm learning how to use JavaScript, to make my websites interactive. In other words:
                        <strong>even better</strong>.

                    <p>
                        I know how to shoot good photos with my DSLR camera. I'm not a professional, but I'm not a
                        rookie either.

                    <p>
                        I have some knowledge on video editing. The programs I've used are iMovie, VITA and Windows
                        Video Editor (the one integrated in the Photos app).

                    <p>
                        I started 3D printing almost 2 years ago. I just love it. I have a Creality Ender 3 and I learned
                        to use it pretty well. With 3D printing I also learned how to use Cura in every single aspect and
                        the fundamentals of Autodesk Fusion 360.

            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Projects</h2>
            <p>Right now I <strong>don't</strong> have any real projects under development. Instead here I'll show you
                some dummy websites I made.
                I made those dummy websites for the "Full-Stack Developer" course in the <a
                    href="https://www.codecademy.com">
                    Codecademy</a> website. <strong>Click the images to access the websites</strong>.

                        <h3>Tea Cozy</h3>
                        <p>This website is about a fictional tea business. It's the <strong>first website</strong> I
                            made during the course.</p>

                        <h3>South Village Run Club</h3>
                        <p>This the second website I've made. It talks about a running club, that doesn't actually
                            exist. However, this wasn't entirely
                            original. The idea was taken from Codecademy's example, and I made the design <strong>better
                                and responsive.</strong></p>

            <h2>üíª How I made this website</h2>
            <div>
                <img src="assets/bts.png">
                <p>I made an entire page about how I made the website and what I used. You can find it in the "Behind the 
                    Scenes" button in the navbar. Anyways, here's a small recap:<br><br>
                    I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> as my code editor,
                    and I took the icons from a website called <a href="https://www.icons8.com/">icons8</a>. Feel
                    free to take a look there, it's a great website with lots of icons. To use them for free you just need to 
                    insert a link in your website. <br><br>The image on the
                    left is a screenshot
                    of me programming the website, while it wasn't even completed yet. This website took a few weeks to
                    make. The initial version was different
                    from the final one. <br><br>I tried to make the best design possible while not making it too
                    complicated, and I think I succeded at this task! I hope
                    you like this website as much as me, but, if you want to give me some suggestions or report a bug,
                    contact me or write an issue on this
