            <p>
                Hi, I am Alessandro Sherhey. I'm a 14 year old Italian boy born in Siracusa, Sicily. I currently live
                in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, which is in Italy. From when I was a kid I had a big passion for
                coding,
                and now I also have a second one: 3D printing. I made this website not only to practice my HTML and CSS
                skills,
                but also to share my projects with other people like you! :)
            </p>

                    <p>I know the HyperText Markup Language pretty well. It's the first programming language I started learning.</p>

                    <p>I know the Cascading StyleSheet language well too. Not as much as HTML, but I know how to use more advanced things
                        like the Flexbox.

                    <p>Now I'm learning how to use JavaScript, to make my website interactive. In other words: <strong>even better</strong>.</p>

            <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Projects</h2>
            <p>Right now I don't have any real projects under development. Instead here I'll show you some dummy websites I made. 
                I made those dummy websites for the "Full-Stack Developer" course in the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">
                    Codecademy</a> website. You can click the images to access the websites.
                </p>
            <div id="pcontainer">
                <div>
                    <a href="https://alessandro-sherhey.github.io/teacozy/"><img src="/assets/tea_cozy.png"></a>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Tea Cozy</h3>
                        <p>This website is about to a fictional tea business. It's the first website I made during the course.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>South Village Run Club</h3>
                        <p>This the second website I've made. It talks about a fictional running club. However, this wasn't entirely
                            original. The idea was taken from Codecademy's example, and I made the design better and responsive. </p>

            <h2>üíª How I made this website</h2>
            <div>
                <img src="assets/bts1.png">
                <p>I made this website entirely on original ideas. I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> as my code editor,
                    and I took the icons from a website called <a href="https://www.icons8.com/">icons8</a>. Feel
                    free to take a look there, it's a great website with lots of free icons. <br><br>The image on the left is a screenshot
                    of me programming the website, while it wasn't even completed yet. This website took a few weeks to make. The initial version was different
                    from the final one. <br><br>I tried to make the best design possible while not making it too complicated, and I think I succeded at this task! I hope
                    you like this website as much as me, but, if you want to give me some suggestions or report a bug, contact me or write an issue on this 
                    website's <a target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.<!---
