# alessandro-sherhey-website

These are the files for my personal website. The website is currently in the **beta v0.2** version. Why *beta*? Because the website isn't fully ready yet: it has still some minor design issues and I'm sure it has some other small issues that I haven't discovered yet. In this **readme** I'll write every changelog, so be sure to check this repository if you're interested in the development of this website.

### Upcoming features ###

- **New email to contact me**: you'll be able to write me emails if you want to. With beta v0.3 I'll create a custom email address just for this website!


### Changelog beta v0.2

**Bug fixes**
- **Important:** Fixed issue #3 where background images paths weren't recognized by GitHub Pages, making the background not visible.
- Fixed issue #1 where the HTML and CSS logos weren't optimized for dark mode.

**Enhancements**
