These are the files for my personal website. Right now I'm preparing everything for the release of the **BETA v0.1** version of the website. This website
still has some bugs to fix, hence the name "beta". I have to fix a few issues like:

### Adding alternative options to color gradients for those who don't use Safari
I have some gradient text that looks really good with Safari. But to make these gradient text I had to use WebKit properties, which are supported only
on Safari. That's why I'm planning to use some alternatives for those who are on other operating systems or just prefer using a different browser.

### Fixing attributions to icons8 for their icons
I used some of their icons for their website, and I realized today that I have to give attribution for *every single icon*, not just for one. But that's
okay.

### Other minor issues
Issues that aren't worth explaining here, they're fixable in less than an hour.

In this README I'll also write a roadmap for new features I want to add in this website. Hope you'll like the website as much as I do :)
