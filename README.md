# alessandro-sherhey-website

Hello everyone! These are the files for my personal website. I made it to practice my HTML and CSS skills and to share some of my projects with you!

Keep in mind that the website is still in **beta**. That means that it couldn't work well under certain circumstances, like I wrote in the website `footer`. I test the website every day or two and see if I find new bugs to fix.

If you want to see all the changelogs you can find them here: https://alessandro-sherhey.github.io/alessandro-sherhey-website/changelog/changelog.html

If you find any problems or you want to suggest some changes/new features feel free to write them in Issues!
