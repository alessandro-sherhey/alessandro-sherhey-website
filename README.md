# alessandro-sherhey-website

These are the files for my personal website. The website is currently in the **beta v0.6.1** version. Why *beta*? Because the website isn't fully ready yet: it has still some minor design issues and I'm sure it has some other small issues that I haven't discovered yet. ~~In this **readme** I'll write every changelog, so be sure to check this repository if you're interested in the development of this website.~~ The changelog is in a separate webpage. Below you can find the link.

If you find any problems or you want to suggest some changes/new features feel free to write them in Issues!
