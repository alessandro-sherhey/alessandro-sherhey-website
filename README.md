# alessandro-sherhey-website

These are the files for my personal website. The website is currently in the **beta v0.4** version. Why *beta*? Because the website isn't fully ready yet: it has still some minor design issues and I'm sure it has some other small issues that I haven't discovered yet. In this **readme** I'll write every changelog, so be sure to check this repository if you're interested in the development of this website.
